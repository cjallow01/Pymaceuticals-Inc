Analysis

The total count of mice by gender showed that 124 female mice and 125 male mice was identified

Looking at the graphs, the bar chart showed Drug Regimen Capomulin has the maximum mice of 230, Ramicane has 228 while the smallest (Stelasyn) showed a total of 181

It is evidence that there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.

The pie plot showed the distribution of female versus male mice. Percentage of male showed 50.2% while female showed 49.8% which is very closed in gap

The regression analysis helped us to understand how much the average tumor volume (dependent variable) will change when weight of mice change(independent variables). The R-squared value is 0.70, which means 70% the model fit the data, wich is fairely good to predict the data from the model.

Higher R-squared values represent smaller differences between the observed data, and the fitted value. 70% the model explains all of the variation in the response variable around its mean.
